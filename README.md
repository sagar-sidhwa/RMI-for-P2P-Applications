# RMI-for-P2P-Applications

P2P stands for peer to peer. The definition of P2P is ‘A communications model in which each party has the same capabilities and either party can initiate a communication session’.Unlike classic server/client model, where the client always initiates the communication by sending a request and the server can only send a response, in a P2P model all the participants are called ‘peers’ and have the same capabilities.
The base Technology of the software is java RMI (Remote Method Invocation). Using this technology One can execute the methods present on another machine without actually accessing it. All the processing is done on a remote machine and if the method is returning any value this value is transferred through the channel and received on the local machine. On the Client side to access the remote object Client uses the “Stub”. Stub is the proxy for the remote object. Stub is the representation of the remote object which resides on the server side. This stub object is bound with an address through which it is accessed remotely. Using this Stub, the client sends the request to the server, this message is sent to the RRL (Remote reference layer) on the client side which checks the type of the server , whether it is a unicast server or multicast server. RMI should be Unicast. Then this message is sent to the server side through the transport layer.Here we are going to make a file transfer system using RMI protocol.
